# chess
A local two player chess game written in Java

Improvements I want to make:

  -currently there is no draw mechanic, I need to learn the different types of draws and implement them

  -Add a GUI other than the actual chess board (menus and stuff)
  
  -Maybe transition this to a react frontend with Java only for backend
  
  -If above, maybe add online multiplayer capability
  
  -A more ambitious addition would be creating an AI to allow one player mode
  
  -Even more ambitious, using a neural network AI
    I have already created a very basic Java neural network using gradient descent,
    but integrating the two projects will take time
    
  -I would also like to add the ability to export/import board states using the standard format
